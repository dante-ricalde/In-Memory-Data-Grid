I couldn't login in managemente-center 3.9-EA2 using these credentials


Theory	
Runs a one-time command against a service. For example, the following command starts the web service and runs bash as its command.

docker-compose run web bash

# to start a specified service
docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml run hazelcast-client

important commands:
~/In-Memory-DataGrid/hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose/src/main/docker$ docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml ps
~/In-Memory-DataGrid/hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose/src/main/docker$ docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml scale hazelcast=2
~/In-Memory-DataGrid/hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose/src/main/docker$ docker exec -it docker_management-center_1 sh
~/In-Memory-DataGrid/hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose/src/main/docker$ docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml up
~/In-Memory-DataGrid/hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose/src/main/docker$ docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml down



It's possible to specify another Dockerfile in docker-compose to customize the creation of a new image instead of  
downloading the image specified in the service in the docker-compose.yml

management-center:
    image:  hazelcast/management-center:3.9-EA2
    ...
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-management-center
      
In this case instead of downloading the image, built a new image using the name "hazelcast/management-center:3.9-EA2" and
the docker file Dockerfile-management-center and the file start.sh because this is specified in the Dockerfile-management-center file
