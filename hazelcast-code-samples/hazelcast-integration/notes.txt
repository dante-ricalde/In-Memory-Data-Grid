I could connect with management-center to external cluster and to embedded instance hazelcast

In this exercise you have a centralized cluster of hazelcast, which you can scale using
	docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml scale hazelcast=2 &
All the clients connects to this centralized cluster to put messages to a queue named "queue", when you send a message
to the cluster (to a member from the cluster), the message is stored in that member and a backup messages is stored in
all the remaining members

Apart from having a centralized hz cluster, each client has a hz member embedded, you can scale the client using
	docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml scale hazelcast-client=2 &
with the client is scale, all the embedded hz members are configured to form a cluster named "hz.service1", when
a client put a message in a queue "embeddedQueue" to its embedded hz member, the message is stored in that member, but it's
also backed (stored) in the remaining embedded hz members that form the cluster "hz.service1"

to scale several services in a single command
	docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml up --scale hazelcast=2 --scale hazelcast-client=2 --scale service2=2 &

I have configured another service called 'service2', this service has its own hz member instance configured when the name and password of the cluster is the
machine ip, when this service is scaled using 
	docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml up --scale hazelcast=2 --scale hazelcast-client=2 --scale service2=2 &
and you get into the managemenet center http://172.18.0.2:8080/mancenter/main.html# you can see the clusters: hz-compose, hz.service1 and each cluster for each
machine ip (each instance) of the service 'service2' that has been scaled, when you get into a cluster which has an ip (namely it's an instance of the service 'service2')
you can see the queue named 'embeddedQueue' and that queue has 1 message that it has been sent by this service2 instance.
